# BMI_regression_asn
ICS4U Assignment uses linear regression to perfom a scientific analysis.
BMI or Body Mass Index is a long standing measurement tool for measuring a person's health based on the relationship between ther weight and height.  It has lots of cristicisms as to how useful a tool it is for measuring health, especially when it accused of mislabelling people as "obese" in some cases - the most easily to recognize are actually people with a lot of muscle mass (ie they are heavier than normal, but it's 'good' weight.)

But this task isn't much about debating the relevance of BMI.  This challenge is all about analyzing some data.  The data set is not very large, but we can imagine that it could be.  The idea is that we are given some data, given the way scientists want to analyze that data, and you need to output the analysis.
